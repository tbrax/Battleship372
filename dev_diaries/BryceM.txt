Entry 1, Friday, February 10, 2017:

	The group decided on a web-based, pvp battleship game. See user
stories for details on features. We've talked a bit about what languages,
softwares, etc. will be used but we remain flexible. Currently, we are thinking
an Apache web server working with a Python application. Graphics, then, could
be handled simply through html/javascript. A database may or may not be
required. Priority is going to be assigned first to the web infrastructure and
a base for the game -- likely ship placement and board visibility.
